## Development

-   Install [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), possibly using [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo)
    -   The application expects a MongoDB server at `mongodb://localhost:27017/db`
    -   This can be changed by setting the `MONGODB_CONNECTION_URI` to different [connection string](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/connection-string/)
-   `npm install` dependencies
-   `npm start` the development server and the Frontend builder
-   Visit the local website at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
